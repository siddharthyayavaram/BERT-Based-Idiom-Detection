the devil is in the detail
shifting sands

red herring
knight in shining armour

zero-sum game
a voice crying in the wilderness
at the drop of a dime
time after time

sitting duck
throw the baby out with the bathwater
skating on thin ice
playing second fiddle
mend fences
cry me a river
eat words
time will tell

silence is golden
paint the town red
end of the day
fall out

eager beaver
come over
run out
count on
a sight for sore eyes
weak in the knees
never mind
say what
point blank
cheat sheet
in a huff
give up
all the best
pain in the neck
learning curve
as simple as that
take stock
all day long
carry on
slow day
head start
speak up
break open
hang on
what are you up to
at the same time
none of your business
high up
all set
pass away
stay up
go after
drive crazy
speak too soon
a burnt child dreads the fire
blowing smoke
heart goes out to
high time
treasure trove
finishing touch
necessary evil
shades of grey
as different as chalk and cheese
means to an end
line in the sand
full of beans
from pillar to post
shed light
laughter is the best medicine
butter up
buck up
stiff upper lip
wet behind the ears
kill the goose that lays the golden egg
in a nutshell
keep your nose clean
cat got your tongue
from now on
head-on
bite the bullet
in a pickle
walk on eggshell
bun in the oven
tight-lipped
apple polisher
a lot on my plate
far-fetched
no man is an island
bring home the bacon
chill to the marrow
running around like a headless chicken
beck and call
at sixes and sevens
the eleventh hour
bon appetit
back against the wall
button your lip
break the mould
that’s the way the cookie crumbles
feel the pinch
keep your hair on
take a hike
just what the doctor ordered
blow your own trumpet
tear-jerking
spine-tingling
has-been
page-turner
household name
the last thing I want
do justice to
head and shoulders above
bang head against wall
memory like a sieve
like father like son
if it’s the last thing I do
not the sharpest tool in the shed
a trip to the sun
touch off
eat like a horse
time flies
in the cross hairs
pay the piper
rub the wrong way
you can’t make an omelette without breaking a few eggs
forbidden fruit is always the sweetest
out of sight, out of mind
ignorance is bliss
if you scratch my back, I’ll scratch yours
no news is good news
tip of the iceberg
hands are tied
money doesn’t grow on trees
learn to walk before you run
if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it
still waters run deep
first things first
it’s better to be safe than sorry
look before you leap
where there’s a will, there’s a way
many hands make light work
strike while the iron is hot
too many cooks spoil the broth
absence makes the heart grow fonder
honesty is the best policy
grass is always greener on the other side
two heads are better than one
familiarity breeds contempt
there’s no time like the present
all good things must come to an end
beggars can’t be choosers
a watched pot never boils
God helps those who help themselves
never look a gift horse in the mouth
the early bird catches the worm
discretion is the greater part of valour
there’s no place like home
there’s no such thing as a free lunch
birds of a feather flock together
keep your friends close and your enemies closer
hope for the best, but prepare for the worst
fortune favours the bold
follow by
run for cover
when the going gets tough, the tough get going
the squeaky wheel gets the grease
the pen is mightier than the sword
when in Rome, do as the Romans
status quo
cold hearted
breakout
being in love
a cut above
in the meantime
turning point
batten down the hatches
old habits die hard
stack the deck
beef up
learn the ropes
from time to time
two wrongs don’t make a right
come down with
run a tight ship
heads up
get under skin
pass the torch
dream come true
a needle in a haystack
black and blue
fall between the cracks
black out
love me, love my dog
dead as a dodo
strive to do
none of your lip
time and again
concern with

in your face
in the buff
every nook and cranny
in the bag
idle hands are the devil’s tools
icing on the cake
going to hell in a handbasket
lose head
haste makes waste
gut feeling
great minds think alike
good Samaritan
go for broke
go down like a lead balloon
give the slip
get over it
get down to brass tacks
rags to riches
foam at the mouth
flip the bird
flash in the pan
field day
everything but the kitchen sink
drop like flies
down to the wire
don’t look a gift horse in the mouth
curiosity killed the cat
cup of joe
come hell or high water
blood is thicker than water
close, but no cigar
chow down
beat around the bush
all Greek to me
all bark and no bite
toss-up
a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush
ask out
end of story
joined at the hip
dog days
hard cheese
salad days
love child
sealed with a kiss
no love lost
love to death
the course of true love never did run smooth
one cannot love and be wise
all is fair in love and war
an item
labour of love
match made in heaven
pop the question
double date
those three little words
walk out on
leave at the altar
kiss and make up
