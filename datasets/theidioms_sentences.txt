I had a black out at the party and do not remember him bringing me home
From childhood, her daughter has frequent black outs. She is suffering from a neurological disorder
I cannot have another black out. I want to stay awake through the procedure
She blacked out immediately after learning about her father’s death
My parents share a very straightforward relationship, it is like love me, love my dog. They accept each other exactly the way they are in person
I want a man who would love me, love my dog
The reason behind the divorce of Cathy Carl is the arrogance, she always says, “love me, love my dog” which is not a good thing every time in a relationship
When my dad finds out that I have lost the mobile phone, I am as dead as a dodo
The railway minister will be as dead as a dodo when this sting operation is released by the news agency
I purchased a tee shirt last week for a whopping amount and it is already falling apart. The store where I purchased it is as dead as a dodo
The police force is on to him and very soon he will be as dead as a dodo
When the underworld don was caught we all though he would be as dead as a dodo but 10 years later he is still operating from his prison cell
This is perhaps the only politician that I have come across who strives to do what he promised
You have broken the window panes while the mother is not home now. I want none of your lip, and you will help me clean this out before she is back
I keep telling you that I want none of your lip, but you refuse to listen to me. Now I have no other alternative but to complain to the teacher
In the old English film that I saw last night, the villain spoke funny and kept saying, “I want none of your lip” to his own henchmen
The children have been explained this sequence time and again but just refuse to follow suit
The judgement in such cases is repeated time and again but sadly the crime is constantly repeated
This story is played in my school time and again
I have watched this movie time and again but never get bored
You keep making the same mistakes time and again. I will be writing a note to your teacher to let her know of this
I am reminded time and again about the fact that I come from a modest background while they spend like there is no tomorrow. I hate this hypocrisy
The company has no concern with how he keeps up after he has resigned
You should not be concerned with what she does at her own time and space
While I would like to be concerned with everything that happens in your life, I do not have enough time from my own
His mother is concerned with everything that happens at their home. So it is natural that his wife feels like she is being remote controlled
The movie they played on cable last night gave me a chill to the bone. I will not be watching a night time movie any time soon
Passing from nearby a graveyard at night gives me a chill to the bone

She discovered all of his dark secrets after the wedding and it gave her a chill to the bone
The children got a chill to the bone when they discovered that there was someone in the house already when they entered
When I heard the scrapping noise on the door after the horror movie ended, I got a chill to the bone
She was alone in the house and a prank such as this could give her a chill to the bone.
My cousin claims that she does not get a chill to the bone while watching even the best of the horror movies
The sun is up, rise and shine
My mother would always start the day positively. “Rise and shine” she would always say
When you rise and shine to me every day, it starts my day positively
“It is quarter past nine, rise and shine“, this was one of the dialogues in the musical that I went to see with my husband
It is already 8 ‘o’ clock, rise and shine you two
Hey, Carl you are still sleeping, come one rise and shine, we have to go to the long drive today
I am so inspired by my Grandfather, he about 80 years old and still he rise and shine everyday
I am so lazy, I don’t need to rise and shine, please let me sleep little more
The sun is up rise and shine
Rise and shine for today is a new day and a new beginning
I am not going to rise and shine no matter how much you ask me to
“Rise and shine, it is a great morning!” my mother would always wake me up saying this
I asked my husband to rise and shine when he was sleeping until 10 am and was about to miss his office
My husband always wakes me up saying “rise and shine”
The rise and shine of my children is not as pretty since they both are apparently in love with their blankets
The project ran out of steam quite early on and then for it to take of was obviously quite difficult
The problem with this couple was that they ran out of steam within the first few years of their marriage and now are dragging on
The lawyer ran out of steam in his argument in the first phase of the case and so it was not a surprise that he lost
The politician run out of steam to take any action as soon as the elections get over. I have seen it happen over and over again
How can you run out of steam on such an important project? This could be the biggest thing on your resume
The vehicle ran out of steam and is not even a surprise given how old it is
The volunteers start strong but usually run out of steam pretty quickly afterwards
The person went scot-free even though there were many people convinced of his crime because the evidence against him was circumstantial
She intends to get married only when her reputation is scot-free
I went scot-free even though it was me who was the mastermind of the mischief because my mother could never believe that her precious little one could do anything bad
She does not let her children scot-free when they are misbehaving and has different punishments for them every time
The accused thought he would go scot-free just because he had hired a big lawyer! But that did not happen for him
It does not matter if you go scot-free after committing a crime because your conscious will always know what happened and how
Jacob went scot-free in the trial even though he had admitted of his guilt. That was because the court of law also gives a chance to people so that they can improve
The accused was saved by the bell otherwise the judge would have pronounced the sentence today itself
I was saved by the bell otherwise my father was about to uncover what I had done and there is no way that I could have even explained the situation to him
The police officer believed that the man had stolen but he did not have probable cause to search him and hence the culprit was saved by the bell
The fellow has always been a scapegoat since he is the youngest of the four siblings
I used to be treated like a scapegoat in my team because I had less experience but I know better now
You cannot treat your little brother like a scapegoat every time you do something wrong
I know that he is just a scapegoat and that the person who is really behind all this has left the country a long time back
Real investigators are able to identify a scapegoat as soon as they see one. They are the victims that need to be saved
She worked as a scapegoat for most parts of her career while her employer was the actual culprit
He is being as the scapegoat for the betterment of his brother’s political career
My children often use each other as a scapegoat. They tend to keep a count and have a system of returning the favours too. Can you believe that
Armed forces have begun riding shotgun on the car to guard terrified drivers and travelers
Liam got in the back seat, and Emma rode shotgun
My brother, Mark, was riding shotgun with his nose in a book, with my longtime best friend David, in the back
I was riding shotgun, with my older son driving and my younger son wasting his time on some video game in the backseat
Noah was at the wheel, and Amey was riding shotgun with her daughter on her lap
The man has a great sixth sense and manages his business just on his intuition
My sixth sense got sharper when I gave birth to my daughter. I think I was the maternal instinct actually
She has amazing sixth sense and is almost never wrong about such predictions
I don’t believe that anyone could have a sixth sense. It is all made up and intended to misguide innocent people
Do you know that your sixth sense is created to keep you away from troubles and gets sharper when you need it the most
She thinks it is her sixth sense that tells her about upcoming incidents
I have a sixth sense and tend to pay heed to it every time it rings and alarm bell for me
The place is neither skid row nor a main street. You will have to look it up on the maps to find it
I was walking through a skid row and now know why it is not safe. There are dishevelled people everywhere who feel like they would snoop and catch you
The theatre is in the by-alley of the skid row
I hate walking through this skid row to get to my friend’s house
The office was located at a skid row and hence many customers would refrain from going there. As a consultant, my first advice was to find a new premises
She works at the bar at the skid row and makes quite a bit of money
They would never invest in a property on the skid row. You are wasting your time
The manager smelled something fishy and started an investigation. He eventually found that 3 of the 4 employees were stealing from the store
I smell something fishy about this deal that you want to get into
My children gave me a full account of what happened and I could not stop smelling something fishy  They are never really this chatty around me

The son of a gun did wonderfully well at arranging this party and ensuring that everybody has a great time
You son of a gun! You did all this for me
He is such a son of a gun to have travelled so far to see us
You son of a gun! Come here and give your uncle a hug
The mother expected her baby to be a southpaw like her but she was very much right handed
I am a southpaw but my brother is not
It is not necessary that your twins have to be southpaw because you and your husband are like that
The gangster was a southpaw so he needed a special type of a gun. That is what helped the police nab him so easily
All my cousins are southpaw but neither I nor my sister are like that
The couple both have a southpaw
The bank manager is a southpaw so he did not want his desk on the right hand corner of the office
My mother has a southpaw
The caretaker has a southpaw so she always picks the children up from the opposite direction
My son has a southpaw. He takes on my father-in-law and husband
I will have to start from scratch and redo the entire assignment because I missed a key point that was to be worked upon
He is not able to start from scratch now that he has work experience of 8 years
The company expected me to start from scratch because the management only just got interested in the project. This is so unfair
I will start from scratch of it is required to get this done correctly
The prime minister probably realizes that the bigger they are the harder they fall. So he has been very cautious about all of his plans and policies up till now
I know that within the criminal world, the bigger they are the harder they fall. This family has been in business for the longest time and now look at how they have ended up
His family business was the top in the country and they had several brands running successfully. But then the bigger they are the harder they fall. They have slowly started closing things out and intend to keep minimizing
My uncle very well knows that the bigger they are the harder they fall. So he never really talks about his success and has kept the virtue of humility alive in him
Owing to the recession in the global economy, she has limited her business strategies. She is quite aware of the fact that the bigger they are the harder they fall
This European country has seen some amazing times. But then the bigger they are the harder they fall, they are now running off the alms that the rest of the European Union are willing to provide to them
The last straw in their relationship was when he physically abused her. She walked out after that
I am not going to wait for the last straw like you always do. I will do something about the problem much sooner than that
It is sad to see that people always wait until the last straw before they start to take any action in this country
The politician did not see the last straw He did not order any probe before this and now the police are struggling with the investigation
The lawyer explained how this was the fight between them was the last straw before the accused mercilessly murdered the victim
The fellow finally managed to pass his exam. As they say, third time’s a charm
I have invested in such properties before and made huge losses but hoping that the third time’s a charm
The third time’s a charm for me. You will see how I win this game
They have two sons and want a daughter now. Let’s see if the third time’s a charm for them
Alice has failed at two ventures so far but this time her business plan is not only elaborate but also detailed. We are all hoping that the third time’s a charm for her
After hitting the motorcycle, the car driver stopped and he twenty-three skidoo toward the woods
Hey, Sally, it’s too hot today, let’s twenty-three skidoo for the beach
The trip was up a blind alley it seems because the travel agent could not even jot down a proper itinerary. I wonder why they booked a holiday with such a shady company anyway
I wonder if the marriage was up a blind alley from the very beginning
The exam was up a blind alley for me this time because I just did not have the time to study after working two jobs
She is headed up a blind alley being in a relationship with him
I cannot simply watch my children walk up a blind alley
The country has walked up a blind alley after having chosen a presidential candidate such as this one. He has a rubbish track record and an unnecessary mean streak
The prime minister keeps wagging the dog to keep people from actually finding out about the scam and its details
I had to wag the dog so that he does not find out where I had actually gone this afternoon
She often wags the dog so that his mother does not find out about his father’s medical condition. They do not want to frighten her until things are clearer
Although Suzy has just joined the team yesterday she has been wagging the dog since this morning and trying to tell people what to do
The management wags the dog when it comes to the sales department
The restaurant owners had the best of everything at one point. But you know what they say, when it rains, it pours. Today they are left with absolutely nothing
Sid wanted to get rid of his debts and worked really hard at his job. And as they say, when it rains, it pours. He has been given a great travel opportunity which will pay him enough to take care of everything
I completely understand that when it rains, it pours. That is the reason why I save as much of my salary every month as possible
She thought it was just something minor and did not go to a doctor. But you know what? When it rains, it pours. She should have got it checked much earlier
Their residence is totally wild and woolly but all in all I found them to be warm people
I don’t like this wild and woolly look on you. Please get into something more sophisticated this evening
The event theme is wild and woolly and hence you can come as yourself
Have you seen his wild and woolly look? It is ghastly
Women are usually not able to work with his wild and woolly We prefer him to be clean shaved and neat in appearance
I’ve seen wild and woolly looks but none as bad as this one
The wine and dine at this hotel is among the best that you will ever find
She has not had a chance to wine and dine with him yet. It is at that stage that they will get to know each other better
The itinerary has mentioned about wine and dine sessions at the best hotels in country
The wine and dine at the Niko’s Bistro was so bad that we were almost certain that they did not pay any attention to the preps
I may not know about all the fancy wine and dine places but I certainly know about the ones that are good and hearty providers
Would you like to wine and dine with my family on Tuesday
This place is especially known for the wine and dine that they offer
The wine and dine at the Bishop’s is top notch ever since they have hired a new chef
The whole world knows that you can’t take it with you but they still have so much affiliation to their worldly possessions
The saint explained about salvation in his speech and spoke about worldly goods. He said you can’t take it with you so try to introspect your attachment
You can’t take it with you so please get over the obsession with this house
Although it is a nice place you can’t take it with you so try to enjoy it while it lasts
Don’t be so attached to your pet since you can’t take it with you when it is your time to go
You can’t take it with you even though you love it with all your heart
There is zero tolerance towards any gender bias in this company
I have a zero tolerance policy towards people that are dishonest with their work
This organisation has zero tolerance for any cases that include a charge of bribery
I wish there was zero tolerance for crimes committed against women
We live in a liberal society so speaking of zero tolerance towards everything just cannot work out
“You are in school and there is zero tolerance for such stubborn behaviour here” – this is what the teacher told him before taking him to the principal’s office
There is zero tolerance for littering in the society that I live in. That is how we maintain a clean premises
He holds the highest office in the country, how can he have zero tolerance for so many different cultures
You should not have zero tolerance for such things when you know that you have to move to that country eventually. Learn to embrace life how they live
The governor is a self-made man and has had properties around the city even before he joined politics
My son is clear about wanting to become a self-made man. He does not want any help from me

These artists are at the cutting edge of their art and hence the paintings on this side of the exhibit are costlier than the rest
Through the use of cutting edge technology, now we can print organs using 3D printers that can cater to every person requiring an organ transplant
What would some of these illiterate people understand of cutting edge technology
The management was given a ballpark figure at the very beginning of the presentation

This school prepares its students for the rat race from the very beginning

Marie has struggled for a long time to come out of the rat race for a very long time
Her education qualification and street smart attitude never let her get caught in the rat race
The man has an upper hand to his wife. It is reflected in the way he speaks with her
She wanted an upper hand in the business and hence went ahead to buy all the shares that she could find in the market

Have you come across such arrogant behaviour ever in your life
My mother came across this ancient recipe from my grandmother’s things and decided to give it a go. It was absolutely delicious
She should have come across his affair much sooner
Coming across such an important decision in life makes me feel closer to my friends and family
Have you come across such a problem before
The way around such a problem would mean that we lose another 6 months in the completion of this project

The Peace corps is in need of a young blood like Adam
They keep the young blood of today so occupied with work that they do not even have the time to look out of the window let alone lead a revolution
Tell that young blood to just zip it or else I will have him fired
The only reason why he managed to succeed is because he is always open to bringing young blood in his company and accepting ideas
The only problem with this committee is that they do not feel the need to incorporate the young blood in their decision-making processes
We need some young blood in this company, if we want to know the expectations of today’s generation and make our marketing strategies accordingly
The covert operation in Kandahar was handled completely by the young blood of the team

She needs to discipline her children, they can’t just throw a hissy fit every time they cross the ice cream parlour
I threw a hissy fit when I learned that he is not going to come for the event even after promising to do so
No one should be allowed to throw hissy fits for such trivial things

The media these days have no real news to report so paparazzi follow celebrities around until they throw a hissy fit at them

It is important that one does not neglect their children in order to spend quality time at work

You can’t just become a night owl and hope to catch up on the years that you have missed your education
He came home at 4 in the morning after the party. He is such a night owl
Becoming a night owl can have an adverse effect on your health. You should be more careful about getting sleep at the right time, at least in your age

Your father doesn’t always look like it but he was quite a class clown in his days
A class clown makes fun of people but should be sporting enough to be able to laugh at himself
It was shocking to see him so serious after the results were out. Otherwise he is such a class clown
It seems to be the responsibility of the class clown to cheer everyone up after some bad moments. You in particular are very good at it
Not many people know that he has such a painful past and has been admitted in the hospital so many time from the class clown demeanour that he carries currently
A class clown is an integral part of the high school composition, just as the nerds, the jocks the cheer leaders and the rest

She is a dead ringer of one of my friends. I in fact walked up to her at an event mistaking her for my friend
The car that is parked in that garage is a dead ringer of the car that my dad used to own a couple of years back

After visiting the religious site they shave their heads and become as bald as a coot. It is a part of the ritual without which the pilgrimage is not considered complete

To be well read is a very important thing in the current times

After the event and how he behaved there, he was the laughing stock in school for days to come
The host made a mistake in saying out the name of the winner and instantly became a laughing stock for everyone
The media nowadays tries to make a sensation out of everything. It is a laughing stock for some who understand how journalism should really be
I do not believe in this mumbo jumbo, human life should be valued far more than some ritual that one is not willing to forego

It was a doozy of a ride since the countryside is just so scenic
