Error analysis for VNC Corpus
(Test set has 256 examples)

Error types:

1. Getting correct but predicting extra : The entire idiomatic expression is tagged correctly, but it is also tagging extra in an alternate location
2. Literal : The prediction is tagging an idiom but it is being used in a literal sense here
3. Predicting Extra : Predicting the correct idiomatic tokens + tokens surrounding the idiom
4. Predicting Partial : Partially predicts the idiomatic tags
5. Predicting nothing : Predicting no tokens as idiomatic even when idiom is present
