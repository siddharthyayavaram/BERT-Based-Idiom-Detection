Error analysis for EPIE Formal Dataset
(Test set has 315 examples)

Error types:

1. Getting correct but predicting extra : The entire idiomatic expression is tagged correctly, but it is also tagging extra in an alternate location
2. Completely Wrong : Predicting another expression as an idiom [1 particular example has 500 tokens and is completely wrong in all cases]
-- there are examples where the idiom is repeated, but the incorrect instance is being tagged instead
3. Predicting Extra : Predicting the correct idiomatic tokens + tokens surrounding the idiom
4. Predicting Partial : Partially predicts the idiomatic tags
5. Predicting nothing : Predicting no tokens as idiomatic even when idiom is present
6. Partial Correct and extra wrong : Predicting the idiomatic part partially correctly, but also tagging alternate parts as idiomatic
