# BERT-based Idiom Identification using Language Translation and Word Cohesion

This repository is intended to provide a collection of the most important files related to "BERT-based Idiom Identification using Language Translation and Word Cohesion".

## Code Directory

### Jupyter Notebooks:

1. `fix.ipynb`: Utilized to align incorrect predictions of the model on the test set for error analysis.
2. `scrape.ipynb`: Used to scrape, preprocess, and annotate the 'theidioms' dataset from 'https://www.theidioms.com/'.
3. `vnc-nb`: Used for preprocessing, annotation, and analysis of the VNC corpus.

### Python Scripts:

1. `script.py`: Example implementation of our model on the 'formal' dataset, utilizing combined loss as the custom loss function.
2. `generalized.py`: Experiment on generalization, trained on the 'theidioms' dataset and tested on the 'gtrans' dataset.

## Error Analysis

This folder contains subfolders containing the files for the 'formal', 'magpie', and 'vnc' datasets for which Error Analysis and Semantic Accuracy computation is performed.

*Note: Some files may not be available here due to reasons such as file size constraints and sensitivity.*
